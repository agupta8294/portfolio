                            <p>The objective of this project was to create a game using MIT App Inventor.
                                My partner (Maggie Pond) and I decided to create a 9 ball pool game. 
                            The game worked like a normal pool app, but with only nine balls in which the 
                            player would drag the ball to hit other balls and try to score the balls in the 
                            six holes around the pool table. Since I coded the project in the last project of our class, called the Labyrinth, I
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17rbYRJ3TdKAaWnlugZMH9ZXAzJuFxOCiJrZ6lsBATz4/edit#heading=h.u3knag90vwnk">
                            documented</a> the project this time. We used this project to develop our skills of teamwork
                            ,communication,and how to spot and fix bugs. One big challenge I overcame was when if you 
                            knocked a ball into one of the pockets,it would not come back unless you hit the New 
                            Game button multiple times. I fixed that error by reversing the order of commands and 
                            setting the visibility of the balls to true, and I also moved the balls to the center to 
                            make sure it would not happen again.

                                The objective of this project was to create a game using Scratch. 
                            My partner (Kaden Fox) and I decided to create a Labyrinth game in which 
                            players would go through a maze and try to find their way out. I coded this 
                            project while my partner mainly focused on <a href=”https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Qk-juhv6iX
                            3y93NdUxZbdks8oO3Xr44b0rQ0d0c6iw/edit”>documenting</a> the project. I used this project to develop my 
                            skills of leadership and creative thinking. One big challenge I overcame was when we could 
                            not find a way to get the maze model (which was created with Microsoft Paint) to become 
                            a sprite in Scratch. I figured out a way to do this by taking a screenshot of the maze 
                            and uploading the photo to Scratch.
