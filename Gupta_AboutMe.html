                            Hello! My name is Anurag Gupta. I am currently enrolled at 
                        Dublin High School as a freshman. My career goal is to be a software engineer.
                        My plan to achieve that goal is to take computer science courses in high school,
                        which I am doing during my freshman year. I plan to take Principles of 
                        Engineering in my sophomore year to learn more about Engineering. 
                        Then I will try to join the Engineering Academy in my sophomore year and hopefully get in. 
                        </p>

                        <p>I am very organized, flexible, creative, and I am a team player. In the entirety 
                        of middle school, I was in the Chess Club. During that time I won multiple trophies 
                        for my chess team, including a 3rd place CalChess K-8 School teams trophy. I was also
                        in the Fallon Engineering Lab in 7th grade, and was in a student-started club for table 
                        tennis in the 8th grade. Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, playing the 
                        guitar, and playing video games. This shows that I am a multipotentialite , because 
                        I have many different skills and interests. Some engineering skills that I possess are being able 
                        to code HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) proficiently,
                        and I can also code basic Bootstrap, Python and I know how to use Git.
                        </p>
